            <p class="speech">And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was
            shameful!</p>
            
            <h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
            <p class="speech">It was indeed. The scene was worthy of the brush of Aibazofski.</p>
            
            <h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
            <p class="speech">I wish I'd never laid eyes on them.</p> 
            <p class="direction">[_A pause_]</p>
            <p class="speech"> Now we shall have
            things as they were again: tea at eight, dinner at one, and supper in

            <p class="speech"> Yes, we haven't had noodles for ages. 
            <p class="direction">[A pause]</p>
            <p class="speech">Not for ages.</p>
            As I was going through the village this morning, Marina, one of the
            shop-keepers called after me, "Hi! you hanger-on!" I felt it bitterly.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
            <p class="speech">In the garden with the doctor, looking for Ivan. They fear he
            may lay violent hands on himself.</p>
