    <h1>Bhargava does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
<p class="direction:hover">[_Trybing to_wind_more quickly_]</p>
<p class="speech">I am a little tired.</p>

<h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
<p class="speech">They are going to Kharkoff to live.</p>

<h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
<p class="speech">They do well to go.</p>

<h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
<p class="speech"> They have been frightened. The professor's wife won't stay here
an hour longer. "If we are going at all, let's be off," says she, "we
shall go to Kharkoff and look about us, and then we can send for our
things." They are travelling light. It seems, Marina, that fate has
decreed for them not to live here.</p>
<h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
<p class="speech">And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was
shameful!</p>

<h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
<p class="speech">It was indeed. The scene was worthy of the brush of Aibazofski.</p>

<h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
<p class="speech">I wish I'd never laid eyes on them.</p> 
<p class="direction">[_A pause_]</p>
<p class="speech"> Now we shall have
things as they were again: tea at eight, dinner at one, and supper in
the evening; everything in order as decent folks, as Christians like to
have it. 
<p class="direction:hover">[_Sighs_]</p>
<p class="speech">It is a long time since I have eaten noodles.</p>

<h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
<p class="speech"> Yes, we haven't had noodles for ages. 
<p class="direction">[A pause]</p>
<p class="speech">Not for ages.</p>
As I was going through the village this morning, Marina, one of the
shop-keepers called after me, "Hi! you hanger-on!" I felt it bitterly.</p>
<h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
<p class="speech"> Don't pay the least attention to them, master; we are all
dependents on God. You and Sonia and all of us. Every one must work, no
one can sit idle. Where is Sonia?</p>

<h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
<p class="speech">In the garden with the doctor, looking for Ivan. They fear he
may lay violent hands on himself.</p>

<h3 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h3>
<p class="speech">Where is his pistol?</p>

<h3 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN</h3>
<p class="direction:hover">[_Whispers_]</p>
<p class="speech">I hid it in the cellar.</p>

<h3 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h3>
<p class="speech">ASTROFF come in.</p>

<h3 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h3>
<p class="speech">Leave me alone!</p>
<p class="direction:hover">[_To MARINA and TELEGIN_]</p>
<p class="speech">Go away! Go away and
leave me to myself, if but for an hour. I won't have you watching me
like this!</p>
